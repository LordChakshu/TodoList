React TodoList Project
This project is a simple TodoList application built with React, which I developed in 2022 as a way to understand the fundamentals of React.

Description
The React TodoList project allows users to create, manage, and organize their tasks in a user-friendly interface. It provides features such as adding new tasks, marking tasks as completed, editing existing tasks, and removing tasks. The application dynamically updates the task list without requiring a page refresh, providing a seamless user experience.
